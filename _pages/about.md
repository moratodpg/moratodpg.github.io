I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in reinforcement learning and computer vision at [AiDAPT, TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/ai/aidapt#c871580).  
My research focuses on the investigation and advancement of efficient methods for optimal sequential decision-making under uncertainty and imperfect information. My current research projects involve the development of algorithmic platforms relying on Markov Decision Processes, Bayesian Networks, and Deep Reinforcement Learning for managing large-scale engineering systems, with emphasis on offshore wind applications.
